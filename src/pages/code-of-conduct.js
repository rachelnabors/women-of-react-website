      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        A primary goal of this Code of Conduct is to be inclusive to the largest
        number of people, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
        As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
        environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
        ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).
      </p>

      <p>
        This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
        participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
        unacceptable behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create safe
        and positive experiences for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h2>

      <p>
        A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open
        [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to
        recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their
        effects on our community.
      </p>

      <p>
        Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
        is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of
        power that exist in society.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
        is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to
        the fullest extent, we want to know.
      </p>

        community organizers are available to help community members engage with
        local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
        unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events,
        organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person
        experiencing distress.
